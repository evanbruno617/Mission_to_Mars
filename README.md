# Mission_to_Mars

## Purpose

To extract latest news about mars and display it on a website as well as recent images and a table depiciting informational data about the planet. 

## Results

I accomplish this by scraping data from NASA's site regarding the latest Mars. This scrape application will be available to users in the form of a button on the page to allow them to access the latest information using this file ![scrape](https://github.com/evanbruno617/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/images/scrape.png)

I then use my [app.py](https://github.com/evanbruno617/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/images/app.png) file along with my [Index](https://github.com/evanbruno617/Mission_to_Mars/blob/main/templates/index2.html) to activate this file and build my site.

The final result of this site looks like this:
